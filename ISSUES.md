# ISSUES (bugs/feature requests)

Lightweight tracker. Claude checks this file at every prompt: small unambiguous
items get fixed and marked `- [x]` with a note; ambiguous ones get a question;
big ones become milestones. Add new items as `- [ ]` under a heading.
Unsolved items go at the top of each chapter; solved ones sink below.

# Global

- [x] Closing the app should ask if wanting to save first
      (asks only when there are unsaved changes: Save / Discard / Cancel; the
      untouched startup state doesn't count as unsaved)

# Midi record

- [ ] New mode for record: punch in/out - needs fine-grained settings, not
      implemented yet; placeholder noted in DESIGN.md
- [x] Ctrl-Z, Shift-Ctrl-Z works on recorded midi (not only inside editor)
      (global shortcut acts on the selected track's clip history; Ctrl-Y too)
- [x] When recording with replace, no midi data is played from that track during
      the take (live monitoring unaffected; semantics updated in DESIGN.md)

## Midi editing

- [x] Edit modes (dropdown): select (key S), draw (key D)
      (Draw: click adds a note at the length dropdown's value, dragging stretches
      it; Select: marquee/move/resize as before, double-click still adds)
- [x] Button for snap to grid, named "Snap"
      (toolbar toggle; when off, notes draw and move freely between grid lines)
- [x] Two note-length dropdowns: one for note-length (new notes), one for
      "snap to grid" (snapping + quantize share it)
- [x] Move selected notes with arrows: Up/Down a half step, Ctrl+Up/Down an
      octave, Left/Right by the snap grid
